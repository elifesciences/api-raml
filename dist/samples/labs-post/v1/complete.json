Upon settlement, the tadpole phase of the <i>B. schlosseri</i> lifecycle (<b>A</b>) will metamorphose into a founder individual (oozooid) (<b>B</b>), which through asexual budding, generates a colony. The colony includes three overlapping generations: an adult zooid, a primary bud, and a secondary bud, all of which are connected via a vascular network (bv) embedded within a gelatinous matrix (termed tunic). The common vasculature terminates in finger-like protrusions (termed ampullae; <b>B</b>–<b>D</b>). Bud development commences in stage A (<b>C</b>). Through budding, <i>B. schlosseri</i> generates its entire body, including digestive (ds) and respiratory (brs) systems, a simple tube-like heart (h), an endostyle (en) that harbors a stem cell niche, a primitive neural complex, and siphons used for feeding, waste, and releasing larvae (<b>B</b>–<b>D</b>). Each week, successive buds grow large (<b>D</b>) and complete replication of all zooids in the colony, ultimately replacing the previous generation’s zooids, which die through a massive apoptosis.
