We investigated three key areas of the macaque cortical grasping circuit with microelectrode arrays and found cooperative but anatomically separated visual and motor processes. The parietal area AIP operated primarily in a visual mode. Its neuronal population revealed a specialization for shape processing, even for abstract geometries, and processed object features ultimately important for grasping. Premotor area F5 acted as a hub that shared the visual coding of AIP only temporarily and switched to highly dominant motor signals towards movement planning and execution. We visualize these non-discrete premotor signals that drive the primary motor cortex M1 to reflect the movement of the grasping hand. Our results reveal visual and motor features encoded in the grasping circuit and their communication to achieve transformation for grasping."

These neurons specialized in processing information about the shape of an object, including information that was ultimately important for grasping it. In contrast, the premotor area F5 represented visual information about the object only briefly, quickly switching to representing information about the upcoming movement as it was planned and carried out. Finally, the neurons in the primary motor cortex were only active during the actual hand movement, and their activity strongly reflected the action of hand as it grasped the object."

Although such operations seem to be effortless, their underlying neuronal mechanisms are highly complex and require extensive computational resources (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</a>).

Within this network, AIP provides access to the dorsal visual stream that processes vision for action (<a href=\"#bib8\">Culham et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Goodale et al., 1994</a>). In fact, neurons in AIP were shown to strongly respond to the presentation of graspable objects or 3D contours (<a href=\"#bib25\" >Murata et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Taira et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Theys et al., 2012b</a>), but could also encode specific grip types (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baumann et al., 2009</a>). This grasp-relevant information processed in AIP is exchanged with F5 via dense reciprocal connections (<a href=\"#bib4\">Borra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gerbella et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Luppino et al., 1999</a>). Accordingly, deactivation of AIP or F5 causes severe deficits in pre-shaping the hand while approaching an object (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fogassi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gallese et al., 1994</a>). In contrast to AIP, concurrent electrophysiological studies suggest that F5 is primarily encoding objects in motor terms and is storing context-specific grip type information (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fluet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Raos et al., 2006</a>). Connections of the dorsal subdivision of F5 (F5p) to the spinal cord and to M1 provide further evidence for the important role of F5 for grasp movement preparation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borra et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dum and Strick, 2005</a>)."

In detail, it has been suggested that visual features extracted in AIP activate motor prototypes in F5, which store hand configurations according to an object’s geometry (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</a>).

Investigations at the neural level therefore necessitate multidimensional observations from many neurons.

Disassociating both neuronal representations therefore requires highly variable visual stimuli and motor responses."

The modulated population was not only larger (sliding ANOVA, <a href=\"#fig3\" >Figure 3</a>), but also significantly faster appearing after stimulus onset than in F5 (49.7 ms and 54.9 ms, monkey M and Z respectively). Impressively, individual AIP cells were capable of differentiating object shapes at high precision (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). To quantify this attribute, we computed a modulation depth analysis that determined the relative difference in firing rate between all pairs of conditions (objects) during the cue epoch (see Materials and methods). The example cell of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a> revealed a chequered structure caused by the shape-wise order of object conditions 00–76 (for object id, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) and a maximum modulation depth (MD) of 62 Hz. Statistical analysis between all conditions (ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey-Kramer criterion, p&lt;0.01; see Materials and methods) revealed a high encoding capacity of the example neuron that could significantly separate 71% of the 946 condition pairs (44 conditions). Interestingly, the neuron decreased its MD in darkness but maintained its encoding of shape (as also indicated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>)."

This separation created small offsets already in the fixation epoch, but at very low modulations. An extreme case is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>. This might raise concerns on whether coding in AIP was really due to object shape, or rather to the object presentation order (different turntables presented sequentially). However, shape-wise clustering in AIP cannot be explained by the task design for the following reasons: (1) The offsets in the fixation epoch were very small in comparison to the visual modulations observed in AIP when the objects were presented (e.g., see <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). (2) The set of 'mixed' objects – presented and grasped in the same block – clustered with other objects of the same shape (e.g. ring in mixed block clusters with other ring objects). Together, this demonstrates clear shape processing in AIP."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e–f</a> and supplements, the majority of objects were located closest to objects of similar size, but with significantly shorter neural distances in comparison to shape features. The secondary role of size was surprising, since object size has significant influence on the aperture of the grasping hand (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jakobson and Goodale, 1991</a>)."

In theory, a purely visual area should differentiate both sets of shapes, since they both provide different visual stimuli. In contrast, an exclusive motor area should not show modulations for the abstract objects because they require the same grip. Strikingly, the AIP population responded highly similar to the presentation (cue epoch) of mixed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>) and abstract (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>) objects (t-test, p&gt;0.05; 35% vs. 35% and 20% vs. 17% comparing mixed and abstract objects in monkey Z and M, respectively).

However, the number of significantly tuned cells decreased during these epochs in comparison to the responses evoked by the mixed objects (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). This reduced selectivity could indicate either motor or visual transformations that are both required for grasping: First, the abstract objects were grasped with the same hand configuration (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). Unmodulated activity could therefore reflect the same motor affordance across the six abstract objects (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</a>). Second, the abstract objects have different shapes, but have the graspable handle in common that shares the same geometrical dimensions across all six objects (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). A uniform modulation could therefore also represent visual processes that reduce the objects to its parts relevant for grasping (i.e. the same geometries of the handle across the six abstract objects). Considering that the same AIP population separated the complete object set primarily on their geometrical features (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e–f</a>) would suggest visual rather than motor transformations explaining uniform modulations."

To create such a scenario, monkeys were trained to perform power or precision grips on the same object, the handle (condition 00 and 01). Although both conditions were located most distantly in the kinematic or joint-angle (J-) space in both monkeys (see <a href=\"#fig4\" >Figure 4e</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5a</a>), they were located closest to each other in the N-space of AIP (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e–f</a>), clearly implying a visual representation of the handle. Statistical analysis revealed, however, that both conditions (00, 01) slightly increased their neural distance (<a href=\"#fig2\" >Figure 2d</a>) towards planning and movement execution, as expressed by an average of 21% and 16% of significantly tuned AIP neurons in monkey Z and M (ANOVA tested in grasp epoch, p&lt;0.01). These observations suggest a visual representation of the handle and a further differentiation of its parts that are relevant for grasping."

Using the planning activity of the example neuron alone, about 43% of the task conditions could be separated, thereby demonstrating the important role of F5 for hand movement planning."

For this, similarity measures were performed between the J-space and the N-space of AIP, F5 and M1 using PCRA (see Materials and methods). A similarity of '0' indicates a complete match between the distribution of trials (n &gt; 500) in N-space and in J-space, whereas values close to '1' represent high divergences between the clustering in both spaces. In accordance with the previous analysis, M1 demonstrated the highest similarity to the J-space (averaged value across 10 recording sessions for monkey M: 0.48, for monkey Z: 0.59), followed by F5 (monkey M: 0.61; monkey Z: 0.65) and AIP (monkey M: 0.75; monkey Z: 0.75).

These smaller neural distances with respect to size are remarkable, in particular since this feature is highly relevant for controlling hand aperture (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jakobson and Goodale, 1991</a>). A possible explanation for this effect could be the higher computational effort (more neurons) required for processing shape in comparison to size."

We emphasize that visual coding at the population level does not preclude motor coding of some individual cells, as suggested previously (<a href=\"#bib24\">Murata et al., 1997</a>).

These modulations could reflect either motor (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</a>) or visual transformations required for grasping. In fact, when grasping an object, both processes are required: the visual selection of (focus on) object parts and the selection of a corresponding hand configuration. Several indicators in our data suggest visual rather than motor transformations in AIP: First, the population separated the entire set of objects in visual terms, but differentiated same objects when grasped differently. Second, the separation of the same object when grasped differently, originated from one object shape cluster. In line with these findings, <a href=\"#bib1\">Baumann et al. (2009)</a> demonstrated that AIP planning activity depends on the previous visual knowledge of an object (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> in their paper). Presenting an object (the same handle as we used) caused a strong visual activation in the AIP population that got separated when a grip type (precision or power grip) was instructed subsequently. In contrast, instructing the grip type before object presentation did not lead to a substantial population response and caused significant modulations only after the object was presented. These differentiation schemes support our hypothesis of visual rather than motor transformations in AIP."

This suggests a rapid appearance of grip features in F5 shortly after object presentation. However, F5 also contained a small subgroup of neurons that represented pure visual information during the cue epoch (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The vast majority of these cells have been recorded from the ventral array, i.e., they originate from the F5a subdivision. In line, electrophysiological investigations of area F5a demonstrated selectivity for 3D shape (<a href=\"#bib46\" >Theys et al., 2012a</a>). We suggest that these neurons receive direct visual input from AIP and might be crucially involved in the activation of stored motor plans. Similar modulation patterns in AIP and F5 during object presentation suggest the communication of visual properties to premotor cortex (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>).

Similar to the visualization of firing rates, we first smoothed all spike trains with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 50 ms) and then performed a sliding ANOVA in time steps of 1 ms (p&lt;0.01; no multi-comparison correction, ≥10 trials/condition). Sliding ANOVA results were then averaged across all recording sessions to visualize results (<a href=\"#fig3\" >Figure 3</a>). Due to the variable length of the planning epoch, trials were first aligned to the cue-onset and then to the grasp-onset event. Abstract shapes were introduced at a later stage of the project (included in 12 recording sessions, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>), whereas all other conditions were tested in all 20 recording sessions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Please note: Irregular grips were detected in the J-space and excluded for the sliding ANOVA analysis of the abstract shapes (<a href=\"#fig3\" >Figure 3b</a>).

In the context of this study, PCRA was used to evaluate the resemblance between the J- and the N-space (firing rates). For this, we reduced both representations to their highest common dimension (i.e., 27 DOF of hand and arm) using the dimensionality reduction methods explained above (i.e., CDA for N-space). This produced datasets of identical number of trials (e.g., 600) and dimensions (e.g., 27). Then PCRA was used to translate and rotate the space of interest (e.g., N-space of M1, F5, or AIP) in a way that minimized the sum of squared distances (SSD) to the corresponding points in the reference space (e.g., J-space) (Matlab function: procrustes). The resulting transform was used to visualize and quantify the amount of similarity to the reference space (J-space). As a numerical measure of similarity, the sum of squared distances between the new transform and the reference frame was computed and normalized by the sum of squared distances between points of the reference space to their dimensional means (Matlab function: procrustes). This similarity measure is a non-negative number with values near 0 implying a high similarity between the multidimensional spaces and values approaching (or exceeding) 1 implying strong dissimilarity."

Within each of the resulting bins we then (4) computed the Euclidean distance between all possible pairs of trials in the N-space. This leads, separately for each area AIP, F5 and M1, to a distance matrix of the size <i>m<sup>2</sup></i>, where m is the number of trials that represents the neural population difference across different trials and trial conditions. Pairs of such matrices from AIP, F5, and M1 were then (5) correlated for every time bin (Spearman’s correlation coefficient), which led to a correlation function across time for each pair of areas (AIP-F5, AIP-M1, and F5-M1). This correlation function represents for every time in the task the similarity of the encoded features between both areas. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a> visualizes these distance matrices and the resulting correlation function over the time."

Authorization for conducting this study has been granted by the regional government office, the Animal Welfare Division of the Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety of the State of Lower Saxony, Germany (permit no. 032/09). Monkey handling also followed the recommendations of the Weatherall Report of good animal practice. Animals were pairhoused in a spacious cage (well exceeding legal requirements) and were maintained on a 12-hour on/off lighting schedule. Housing procedures included an environmental enrichment program with access to toys, swings, and hidden treats (e.g., seeds in sawdust). Monkeys had visual and auditory contact to other monkeys. They were fed on a diet of enriched biscuits and fruits. Daily access to fluids was controlled during training and experimental periods to promote behavioral motivation. All surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize post-surgical pain or suffering. Institutional veterinarians continually monitored animal health and well-being."

In fact, 76% of the visual (abstract objects) and 72% of visuomotor tuned neurons (mixed objects) recorded from F5 were detected on the ventral site (ANOVA p&lt;0.01, all sessions, tested in cue epoch), in line with previously reported enhanced decoding capabilities of planning signals from ventral F5 (Schaffelhofer et al., 2015a).

The different modalities in both recording sites are in line with the architectonical (Belmalih et al., 2009) and connectionally (Borra et al., 2010; Gerbella et al., 2011) distinct subdivisions F5a and F5p, which largely correspond to the ventral and dorsal recording array, respectively. Distinct connections of F5a with SII, AIP and other subdivision of F5 (but not to M1) (Gerbella et al., 2011) suggest an integration of visual, motor and context specific information (Theys et al., 2013). On the other hand, connections of F5p to the hand area of M1 and to the spinal cord (Borra et al., 2010) suggest a rather direct contribution to hand movement control. Taken together, the multimodal preparation signals with visual and motor contribution and the distinct motor feature coding towards planning and execution supports the important role of F5 in visuomotor transformation.”"
