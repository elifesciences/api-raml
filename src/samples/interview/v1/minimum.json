The time I spent at the hospital and with medical researchers made me realise that I wanted to work in human biology, so I decided to study the virulence of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> during my final year undergraduate project. I found learning about infection fascinating but working in a laboratory was a bit lonely. I then studied a Masters in Public Health, which introduced me to many aspects of public health, including epidemiology. I was particularly interested in using statistical and mathematical techniques to help answer public health questions relating to infectious diseases and I chose to pursue this interest in my PhD."
